Detect the p-site offset.

Step1: Checking the input Arguments.

transcript  :  /mnt/t64/database/sce/ncbi/norm/sce.norm.txt
bam         :  ../step01-qc/ncs2d_elp6d_ribo_YPD2.bam
output      :  ncs2d_elp6d_ribo_YPD2
longest     :  False
min         :  27
max         :  33
exp_peak    :  30
shift       :  2
silence     :  True
detail      :  True
Step2: Import the transcripts annotation.

Step3: Import the bam file.

import file: ../step01-qc/ncs2d_elp6d_ribo_YPD2.bam.

Step4: Detect the tis offset of sequence profile.

Step5: Detect the frame offset of sequence profile.
